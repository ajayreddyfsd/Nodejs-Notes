//3 callbacks
//one to make a request and once u get response, the callback is placed onto CBQ and then onto CS
//then again 2 callbacks for data and end events
//whenever a chunk is received, its callback is placed onto CBQ and then onto CS, happens so many times
//when end of data is detected, places its callback onto CBQ and then onto CS

//! ðŸ§­ Final Map (one-shot view)
// http.request(...) â†’ CS â†’ WebAPI registers response listener â†’ CS empty
// response headers received â†’ WebAPI â†’ CBQ â†’ CS executes (res)
// inside (res) â†’ attaches "data" + "end" â†’ WebAPI â†’ CS empty
// chunk arrives â†’ WebAPI â†’ CBQ â†’ CS executes "data" callback (repeats many times)
// stream ends â†’ WebAPI â†’ CBQ â†’ CS executes "end" callback (once)
